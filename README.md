# Medical-Expert-System

This is a part of the CSF407 AI assignment. A medical expert system is built using _experta_ based on the CLIPS shell.

## Summary

Typical expert systems used the knowledge to reason about
input data and produce meaningful results. This knowledge mostly
consisted of simple if-then rules, like if temperature sensor
values are > 100C then turn off the electric kettle. Knowledge
bases and graphs are still playing a huge role in many
intelligent systems.Many rural areas in India have extremely limited access to medical advice. People travel long distances to clinics, or
medical facilities and there is a shortage of medical experts
in most of these facilities. This results in slow service, and
patients end up waiting long hours without receiving any
attention. Hence, medical expert systems can play a significant
role in such cases where medical experts are not readily
available. A Diagnosis Expert System can help a great deal in
identifying those diseases and describing methods of treatment
to be carried out.
