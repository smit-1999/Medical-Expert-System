Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is vital to good vision. This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in the eye.

It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults.

Glaucoma is the result of damage to the optic nerve. As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your visual field.

This nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.

Elevated eye pressure is due to a buildup of a fluid (aqueous humor) that flows throughout your eye. 

This fluid normally drains into the front of the eye (anterior chamber) through tissue (trabecular meshwork) at the angle where the iris and cornea meet.

When fluid is overproduced or the drainage system doesn't work properly, the fluid can't flow out at its normal rate and pressure builds up.

Types of glaucoma are:

Open-angle glaucoma
Angle-closure glaucoma
Normal-tension glaucoma
Pigmentary glaucoma

Dignosis:

The following are checked for diagnosing Glaucoma:

Pressure in eyes
Drainage angle of eyes
Examination of optic nerve for damage
Testing of peripheral side vision
Measurement of optic nerve
thickness of cornea
