Acute sinusitis (acute rhinosinusitis) causes the cavities around your nasal passages (sinuses) to become inflamed and swollen. This interferes with drainage and causes mucus to build up.

With acute sinusitis, it might be difficult to breathe through your nose. The area around your eyes and face might feel swollen, and you might have throbbing facial pain or a headache.

Acute sinusitis is mostly caused by the common cold. Unless a bacterial infection develops, most cases resolve within a week to 10 days.

In most cases, home remedies are all that's needed to treat acute sinusitis. However, persistent sinusitis can lead to serious infections and other complications. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks despite medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis.

Acute sinusitis is most often caused by the common cold, which is a viral infection. In some cases, a bacterial infection develops.

You may be at increased risk of getting sinusitis if you have:

Hay fever or another allergic condition that affects your sinuses
A nasal passage abnormality, such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors
A medical condition such as cystic fibrosis or an immune system disorder such as HIV/AIDS

Diagnosis:

Redness and swelling of the nasal passages

Purulent (pus like) drainage from the nasal passages (the symptom most likely to clinically diagnose a sinus infection)

Tenderness to percussion (tapping) over the cheeks or forehead region of the sinuses

Swelling about the eyes and cheeks.
