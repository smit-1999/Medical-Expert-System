Depending on the severity of hypothermia, emergency medical care for hypothermia may include one of the following interventions to raise the body temperature:

Passive rewarming: For someone with mild hypothermia, it is enough to cover them with heated blankets and offer warm fluids to drink.

Blood rewarming : Blood may be drawn, warmed and recirculated in the body. A common method of warming blood is the use of a hemodialysis machine, which is normally used to filter blood in people with poor kidney function. Heart bypass machines also may need to be used.

Warm intravenous fluids: A warmed intravenous solution of salt water may be put into a vein to help warm the blood.

Airway rewarming: The use of humidified oxygen administered with a mask or nasal tube can warm the airways and help raise the temperature of the body.

Irrigation: A warm saltwater solution may be used to warm certain areas of the body, such as the area around the lungs (pleura) or the abdominal cavity (peritoneal cavity). The warm liquid is introduced into the affected area with catheters.
